# golestan-grade-checker
Tired of refreshing for grades coming, I decided to write this using Selenium in Python.

Usage:

You need to first create a `.env` file aside cloned files and enter username and password to your Golestan login page in it using this format:
```
USERNAME=<your username>
PASSWORD=<your password>
```

# Requirements:
Python3+
Selenium (For Python)  `pip3 install selenium`

Note: This project sends desktop notifications in Linux Operating System (using `notify-send`). It is not tested on other OSs.
